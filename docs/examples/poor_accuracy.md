# Problem: Accuracy is too low
!!! Question "What are the components going into our system?"

------------------------------------------------------------------

!!! Question "Could something be wrong in SAMPLE PREP that prevents accurate results?""

!!! tip "Use orthogonal measurements (gels, nano-drop, external measurements) to test"

------------------------------------------------------------------

!!! question "Are we recording everything that we expect to record?"

!!! tip "Inject expected signals, _in silico_ or in vivo to validate system response."

------------------------------------------------------------------

!!! question "Are the analysis algorithms performant?"

!!! tip "Directly look at the data and how it performs on data"

!!! tip "Use both toy and more realistic simulations to ensure algorithm accuracy"
